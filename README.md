# Inventory Management System - Angular | Java | Springboot

The Inventory Management System is a full-stack web application developed using Angular for the frontend and Java with Spring Boot for the backend. The system is designed to efficiently manage products, purchases, sales, suppliers, and categories while providing real-time insights through an interactive dashboard.

The application features a Dashboard component that displays visual charts and analytics for purchase and sales data, helping users track inventory movement, identify trends, and make data-driven decisions. The Purchase component allows users to record incoming stock, update inventory levels, and maintain purchase history. The Sell component manages outgoing stock, sales transactions, and automatically adjusts inventory quantities.

A dedicated Category component is used to organize products into logical groups for easier management and reporting, while the Supplier component stores and manages supplier details, enabling smooth tracking of procurement sources. The Profile component allows users to manage their personal information and application settings securely.

The backend is built with Spring Boot, providing RESTful APIs for seamless communication with the Angular frontend. It handles business logic, data validation, and database operations, ensuring scalability and reliability. Overall, the system improves inventory control, reduces manual errors, and provides a centralized platform for managing stock and sales efficiently.
